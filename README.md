Hello there &#x1F91F;, 

I am deeply curious about all things in pharmacometrics and biostatistics. I design and run clinical trials for a living but I am also passionate about coding and programming. R is my favourite tool ‚öôÔ∏è but sometimes I use STATA. You can see a full list of my work on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mak-Wenyao">ResearchGate</a>. If you find my work useful, please feel free to cite them or give me a shout [@_MakWY259](https://twitter.com/_MakWY259). 

Collaboration on research project is very much welcomed! ü§ù

### Sharing my notebook 

I love to write and consider sharing what I learn a great joy. In my free time (sadly, these are rare now.....), I typically write about research findings that does not make it into the papers or some coding skills that I find valuable to jot down. The notebook can be accessed <a href="https://wenyao-mak.netlify.app">here</a>.
