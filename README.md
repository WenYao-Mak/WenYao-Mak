Hello there &#x1F91F;, 

I am deeply curious about all things in pharmacometrics and biostatistics. I design and run clinical trials for a living but I am also passionate about coding and programming. R is my favourite tool ‚öôÔ∏è but sometimes I use STATA. You can see a full list of my work on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mak-Wenyao">ResearchGate</a>. If you find my work useful, please feel free to cite them or give me a shout [@_MakWY259](https://twitter.com/_MakWY259). 

Collaboration on research project is very much welcomed! ü§ù
